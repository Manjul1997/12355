  <h2>  EDUCTION STATUS REPORT – GUJARAT</h2>
  
 
  <i><mark><p>Introduction </p></mark></i>
  <p>Education is one of the most powerful instruments for reducing poverty and inequality and lays a foundation for sustained economic growth. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which include eight goals were framed to address the world's major development challenges including Primary Education. In all regions, inequalities in access to education continue to pose major barriers to fully attaining the MDG 2 target of ensuring that, by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, can complete a full course of primary schooling. Globally, 123 million youth (aged 15 to 24) lack basic reading and writing skills; 61 per cent of them are young women. Too many children are still denied their right to primary education. In 2011, 57 million children of primary school age were out of school, down from 102 million in 2000. More than half of these out-of school children live in sub-Saharan Africa. Significant and substantial progress has been made in meeting many of the MDG targets - including primary education. However, progress in reducing the number of children out of school has slowed considerably over time. Stalled progress means that the world is unlikely to meet the target of universal primary education by 2015. The youth literacy rate (literacy rate of the 15- to 24-year olds) has shown an appreciable increase from 61.9% (1991) to 84.1% (2011). The literacy rate of female youth has increased remarkably from 49.3% in 1991 to 79.9% in 2011, compared to that of males (73.5% in 1991 to 88.6% in 2011). The Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER)1 was 85.4% in 1990 to 107 in 2011 and it is remarkably risen 22 points in a time span of 21 Years. The Net Enrollment Ratio (NER)2 increased by almost 11 points from 84.9% in 2000 to 95.5% in 20103 . Similar to the trend observed for the youth literacy rate, the NER for girls increased from 77% in 2000 to 94% in 2010, versus 92% (2000) to 97% (2010) for boys. The primary completion rate of both boys and girls has increased significantly from 55% in 1992-1993 to 95% in 2010. The primary school completion rate in the year 2011 is 91% for boys and90% for girls4 .</p>

  <p>Literacy is one of the important indicators of social development. Knowledge is linked with literacy and a formal education. And economic growth is related to degree of literacy. Thus literacy is one of the important needs of life as well as future development of a particular region. The literacy rate in Gujarat has seen an upward trend and is 79.31% as per 2011 population census. Compared to the situation in 1951, the improvement in literacy in Gujarat is phenomenal. From literacy rates of barely 29 and 12 per cent for men and women, respectively according to 1951 Census, they have increased to 87.23% for males and 70.73% for females by 2011. Of that, male literacy stands at 87.23% while female literacy is at 70.73%. In actual numbers, total literates in Gujarat stands at 41,093,358 of which males were 23,474,873 and females were 17,618,4856 . There are some of the districts in Gujarat have comparatively higher literacy rate such as Surat (85.53%), Ahmedabad (85.31%), Anand (84.37%), Gandhi Nagar (84.16%) and Navsari (83.88%). Dohad is the district has the literacy rate of 60.60% and stands first from the bottom. The male and female literacy rate in Dohad is 72.14% and 49.02% respectively. In India literacy rate has a significant association with religion and caste. The proportion of literates is lower among the Muslims than that among Hindus. Similarly proportion of literates is lower among the people belongs to Scheduled Caste and Tribes. The main reason for lower proportion of literates among the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes is that they were deprived of educational facilities for generations. According to Scheduled Castes sub plan, Government of Gujarat 2011 – 2012, the population of Scheduled Caste in Gujarat is 35.93 Lakhs (7.09%). The Scheduled tribe population in the state is 8,917,174 (14.8%)7 . 6 </p>
  <p>Gujarat, the birth place of Mahatma Gandhi, is a state situated in the western part of India and shares its northwestern boundary with Pakistan. Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra are the neighboring states of Gujarat. Gandhinagar is the capital and Ahmedabad is its largest city and the main commercial hub of the region. Gujarat houses a wide variety of industries and is considered one among the best industrialized states of the nation. Gujarat is also home to some of the prestigious educational institutes of the nation. Gujarat Population Census Data shows that it has Total Population of 6.03 Crores which is approximately 4.99% of total Indian Population. The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, has, without doubt, become a major milestone to ensure that children aged 6 to 14 are able to get free and compulsory education. </p>
